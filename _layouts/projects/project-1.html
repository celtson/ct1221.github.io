              <h3>Goal</h3>
              <p>Give users the ability to quickly view details of a product from the product grid without being directed to the product detail page.
                The objectives were customer conversions and user interaction.</p>

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
              <h3>Result</h3>
              <p>An easy and efficient way to allow a user to quickly view product details without hindering their shopping experience. Working closely with our Adobe Analytics & Adobe
                Target specialist, the design was found to increase overall customer interaction, resulting in increased revenue. Users wanted to use the design and it only encouraged
                more purchases overall.</p>

            <p class="col-xs-12">
              I decided to see what the competition did for a similar functionality. Three of the websites I reviewed were <a href="https://www.anntaylor.com/" target="_blank">anntaylor.com</a>,
              <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/" target="_blank">wayfair.com</a> and <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/" target="_blank">kohler.com</a>. These were helpful
              in ideating what would potentially work for my project.

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
              <img src="/img/case-study/version1-image-min.jpg" />

              <p>
                In this first iteration it was decided that on hover we would reveal a transparent background over the image with the Quick View button
                in the center. The thought was that having the quick view button on hover covering the product image would work, but that did not work.
                Because both the button and the transparent background contained the quick view link, it resulted in unwanted interactions. Users were expecting
                to go to the product grid if they did not click on the button, however they were always presented with the quick view modal. Although it was a
                negative expereicne we did glean helpful information. The users that interacted with the quick view willingly, did convert, but there were a lot of users
                that showed signs for wanting to see the product grid instead of the modal.
              </p>
              <p>
                We ran this version against what we had on the site and received a negative result, because of the disruption of the user flow. This iteration drove RPV (Revenue Per Visit) down by <strong>-10.4%</strong> and Conversation Rate by
                <strong>-4.8%</strong>.
                For this reason, we dropped this version of the test and I created a new iteration to go against the control using the information we received.

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">
              <p>In this iteration I go after an approach that lended more to the user's decision. With this goal in mind, I removed the transparent background and reduced the quick view's call to
                action footprint. Because the hover interation was removed I had to figure out a way to still make the call to action visible but not interruptive.
                This lead to a small, but recognizable icon at the bottom right of the image. If a user wanted to interact with it they could, and if not it could be easily ignored.</p>

              <p>After making changes to the design, users showed through data that they liked having a quickview on the site. It increased conversion by <strong>1%</strong>, RPV by <strong>3.9%</strong> and raised the Average RPV from $4.86 to
                $7.81 (<strong>an increase of 60%</strong>).</p>
