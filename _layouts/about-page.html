      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>I've been living in The United States for about 10 years now. During those
        10 years, UX design & development has slowly but strongly crept up as one of my top
        passions in life. I work at LifeWay Christian Resources located downtown
        of the music city Nashville. Love my job and love the people I work with.
        In the last few years I became a remote worker for LifeWay and moved to Mount Joy,
        PA with the love of my life and wife, Lauren üòä. Now we have a beautiful baby girl, Nora, who is
        just such a joy.
      </p>
      <p>Entangled with my passion for design and code lies a few other passions.
        I crave music and the beauty of it &ndash; which is why I was originally
        pulled to Nashville &ndash; and take advantage of any opportunity I encounter to better myself.</p>
      <p>Sports and I have been best buddies for quite some time now. Gives me
        a hard time with injuries once in a while, but my love for it will never die. </p>
